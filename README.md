Implementation of operator inference for error estimation to accompany the manuscript [Probabilistic error estimation for non-intrusive reduced models learned from data of systems governed by linear parabolic partial differential equations (arXiv:2005.05890)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05890) by W.I.T. Uy and B. Peherstorfer. The code returns the reduced model operators and operators in the error estimator for intrusive and non-intrusive model reduction as well as relevant error quantities.

The sample script provided <code>main.py</code> considers the heat equation example in the manuscript (Section 4.2) and reproduces Figures 1c,2.

## Note: Code is functional but is undergoing redesign.
